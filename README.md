# vue-component-library-template

Supporting project and code for [Vue Component Library](https://xiegerts.com/series/vue-component-library/) post series.

> In this series, we’ll focus on structuring a Vue component library as a plugin for use, and reuse. That also includes distribution and documentation. That’s what is so great about Vue - the ability to create your own building blocks for designing a user experience. This series of posts is not about writing components, that’s a subject for another day.
